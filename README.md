Welcome to Peep (the network auralizer):
A project developed at Tufts University and currently hosted at Sourceforge.
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/peep/

==========================================================================

  If you're looking at this file, then you're probably (hopefully!)
wondering one of four things: What's new? Where can I get documentation?
Where can I report bugs? How can I get involved in development? If you're
looking for instructions on compiling Peep, see [SRC]/INSTALL. More
in-depth documentation can be found in the Peep general documentation
found in the docs directory in HTML format.

  For a list of new features, just check out the ChangLog in the source
directory. It'll give you an idea of what changes have been made recently,
as well as what new features have been added for a given release.

  If you're looking for documentation, documentation is currently being
assembled in html format and should be available in [SRC]/docs/. To retreive
the latest documentation, please visit the Peep website on Sourceforge. Also,
if you know nothing about the project and have just downloaded the source
because you were curious, I suggest reading the LISA paper on Peep, available
at: http://peep.sourceforge.net.

  To report any bugs found, please use the Sourceforge bug tracker found on
the website. That way your bugs can be better kept track of and addressed in
a timely manner.

  Finally, if you're looking to get involved in the project or looking
to drop off suggestions, please send email to

   Michael Gilfix: mgilfix@eecs.tufts.edu.

  or drop by the Sourceforge website and post your comments in the public
forums. There is also a Peep development mailing list, (which is currently
being used for both solving bugs and development wishes/discussions), which
can be found at peep-develop@lists.sourceforge.net. The project is always
looking for more developers so drop on by or feel free to send some
code my way!

The current Peep development team is:

Michael Gilfix (mgilfix@eecs.tufts.edu)
Collin Starkweather (collin.starkweather@colorado.edu)
Xavier Renault (xavier@ideasandassociates.com)
