<P>Revision 1.1  2001/04/23 10:19:14  starky
<P>Commit in preparation for release 0.4.1.
<P>
<P>o Altered package namespace of Peep clients to Net::Peep
<P>  at the suggestion of a CPAN administrator.
<P>o Changed Peep::Client::Log to Net::Peep::Client::Logparser
<P>  and Peep::Client::System to Net::Peep::Client::Sysmonitor
<P>  for clarity.
<P>o Made adjustments to documentation.
<P>o Fixed miscellaneous bugs.

Revision 1.7  2001/04/17 06:46:21  starky
Hopefully the last commit before submission of the Peep client library
to the CPAN.  Among the changes:</P>
<P>o The clients have been modified somewhat to more elagantly
  clean up pidfiles in response to sigint and sigterm signals.
o Minor changes have been made to the documentation.
o The Peep::Client module searches through a host of directories in
  order to find peep.conf if it is not immediately found in /etc or
  provided on the command line.
o The make test script conf.t was modified to provide output during
  the testing process.
o Changes files and test.pl files were added to prevent specious
  complaints during the make process.</P>
<P>Revision 1.6  2001/03/31 07:51:35  mgilfix</P>
<PRE>
  Last major commit before the 0.4.0 release. All of the newly rewritten
clients and libraries are now working and are nicely formatted. The server
installation has been changed a bit so now peep.conf is generated from
the template file during a configure - which brings us closer to having
a work-out-of-the-box system.</PRE>

<P>Revision 1.7  2001/03/31 02:17:00  mgilfix
Made the final adjustments to for the 0.4.0 release so everything
now works. Lots of changes here: autodiscovery works in every
situation now (client up, server starts &amp; vice-versa), clients
now shutdown elegantly with a SIGTERM or SIGINT and remove their
pidfiles upon exit, broadcast and server definitions in the class
definitions is now parsed correctly, the client libraries now
parse the events so they can translate from names to internal
numbers. There's probably some other changes in there but many
were made :) Also reformatted all of the code, so it uses
consistent indentation.</P>
<P>Revision 1.5  2001/03/28 02:41:48  starky
Created a new client called 'pinger' which pings a set of hosts to check
whether they are alive.  Made some adjustments to the client modules to
accomodate the new client.</P>
<P>Also fixed some trivial pre-0.4.0-launch bugs.</P>
<P>Revision 1.4  2001/03/27 05:49:04  starky
Modified the getClientPort method to accept the 'port' option as
specified on the command line if no client has been specified in the
conf file.</P>
<P>Revision 1.3  2001/03/27 00:44:19  starky
Completed work on rearchitecting the Peep client API, modified client code
to be consistent with the new API, and added and tested the sysmonitor
client, which replaces the uptime client.</P>
<P>This is the last major commit prior to launching the new client code,
though the API or architecture may undergo some initial changes following
launch in response to comments or suggestions from the user and developer
base.</P>
<P>Revision 1.2  2001/03/18 17:17:46  starky
Finally got LogParser (now called logparser) running smoothly.</P>
<P>Revision 1.1  2001/03/16 18:31:59  starky
Initial commit of some very broken code which will eventually comprise
a rearchitecting of the Peep client libraries; most importantly, the
Perl modules.</P>
<P>A detailed e-mail regarding this commit will be posted to the Peep
develop list (<A HREF="mailto:peep-develop@lists.sourceforge.net">peep-develop@lists.sourceforge.net</A>)</P>
