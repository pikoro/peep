What is a PEP?

  PEP is a Peep Enchancement Proposal for adding new features to the "Peep:
  the Network Auralizer" infrastructure. It is based on the PEP system used by
  Python (Python Enhancement Proposals) and follows similar guidelines. The
  PEP documents are stored in CVS in the Peep repository and are also avaiable
  for web-based viewing.

  The PEP documents is intended to be a replacement for the Sourceforge
  feature tracker in assembling serious proposal documents. Unfortunately,
  the Sourceforge tracker doesn't contain enough features (i.e, true revision
  control) and text-based editing is much easier.

PEP Guidelines

  As the Peep PEP's are based on the Python guidelines, they will follow
  the same system. This system is outlined in the Python PEP, which can be
  found at:
