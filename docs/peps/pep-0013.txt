Abstract

  Perl being an ideal cross-platform language, the idea has been
  advanced to generate PPD files, used by ActiveStates PPM (Perl
  Package Manager) to generate clients suitable for Windows
  installations.

  The server itself would be difficult to port, and, in my opinion,
  would not bring in a much wider audience. However, most system
  administrators need to monitor combinations of Windows and Unix
  Machines.

  Given the ease with which most of the clients can be ported to
  Windows, in my opinion, it would be a worthwhile endeavor. However,
  some volunteers would be nice for testing purposes, given that your
  humble author does not have Windows installed on any of his 5
  machines.

  Likewise, given the difficulty of porting the server to Windows and
  my own personal preferences, I would question whether there would be
  sufficient interest or motivation to port the server to Windows.

Specification

  Some clients, such as sysmonitor and webmonitor, rely on system calls
  that rely on executables that are not bundled with Windows.  Thus,
  not all of the clients may be readily convertible to Windows.

  Otherwise, initial research suggests that a PPD distribution can be
  created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker without too much trouble.
