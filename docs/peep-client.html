<P>Net::Peep - Perl extension for Peep:  The Network Auralizer.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>Peep is an open source free software network monitoring tool issued
under the Gnu Public License that presents information via audio
output.  Network diagnosis with Peep is made not only based on single
network events, but the network as a whole ``sounds normal.''</P>
<P>This document serves as an introduction to the Peep clients and the
Peep client architecture.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>
<P>Peep is built on a client-server model in which the clients generate
``events'' based on user-defined criteria (e.g., whether a packet denial
has been logged or a broken link on a web site was found).  One or
several Peep servers are then notified of the events by clients, at
which time an audio signal is generated.</P>
<P>The clients, which include such applications as <CODE>logparser</CODE> and
<CODE>sysmonitor</CODE> and for which this document constitutes introductory
documentation, are written in Perl, IMHO about the coolest language
ever.  The bulk of the client code is composed of a set of Perl
modules comprising objects and base classes for use by Peep clients
and their derivatives.</P>
<P>The server, <CODE>peepd</CODE>, is written in C.</P>
<P>Both the client and server are available for download free of charge
from the Peep homepage located at</P>
<PRE>
  <A HREF="http://peep.sourceforge.net">http://peep.sourceforge.net</A></PRE>
<P><EM>COMING SOON:  </EM>The Peep client modules and executables are also available on the CPAN
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) for installation via the
time-honored</P>
<PRE>
  perl -MCPAN -e &quot;install Net::Peep&quot;</PRE>
<P>In fact, this is the preferred method of installation of the Peep
clients.</P>
<P>Consult the core Peep documentation for more information on
installation and usage of Peep.</P>
<P>The Peep client library is composed of the following modules:</P>

<PRE>
  <A HREF="./client/logparser.html">logparser</A>            Generates events based on matching regular
                       expressions to tailed logs (e.g.,

<H1><A NAME="creating a custom peep client">CREATING A CUSTOM PEEP CLIENT</A></H1>
<P>Please note that the Peep client API has not yet been finalized, and
is subject to change.  If you have any problems with your custom-built
client as a result of changes made to the client API, please contact
Collin Starkweather at <A HREF="mailto:collin.starkweather@colorado.edu.">collin.starkweather@colorado.edu.</A></P>
<P>The Net::Peep::Client module makes constructing a custom Peep client a
breeze.</P>
<P>The Net::Peep::Client::Logparser and Net::Peep::Client::Sysmonitor modules are
excellent references.  Pay particular attention to the Start methods
in each and thier usage of the Net::Peep::BC module, which notifies
the Peep server of Peep client events.</P>
<P>A Peep client by no means has to be a module, however.  It can just as
easily be created as a script.  The Peep::Client::Logparser and
Peep::Client::Sysmonitor modules, which correspond to the logparser
and system clients, were created as modules simply for ease of
distribution.</P>
<P>Basically, the same formula is used for each client.</P>
<P>0) This goes without saying, but I will say it anyway.  First you have
   to instantiate a Net::Peep::Client object.  For convenience, we
   will also create a Net::Peep::Log object for logging and debugging
   messages.  Creating the logging object is by no means necessary.</P>
<PRE>
     use Net::Peep::Client;
     use Net::Peep::Log;
     my $client = new Net::Peep::Client.
     my $log    = new Net::Peep::Log;
</PRE>
<PRE>

1) Tell Net::Peep::Client what command-line options to parse.  For more
   information on how to define command-line options, see
   Getopt::Long, which Net::Peep::Client uses to parse the options.</PRE>
<PRE>
   To do this, create a hash of options.  For more information on the
   format of the options, see the documentation for Getopt::Long.</PRE>
<PRE>
   For example, if you want to use the options 'foo' and 'bar', with
   'foo' accepting a string and 'bar' a binary flag (implying that nobar
   is the negation of the option):</PRE>
<PRE>
     my $foo = ''; # be sure to initialize your options
     my $bar = 0;
     my %options = (
       'foo=s' =&gt; \$foo, # =s implies a string is expected
       'bar!'  =&gt; \$bar  # ! implies negation with nobar
     );</PRE>
<PRE>
   Note that Net::Peep::Client accepts a set of default command-line
   options common to all Peep clients and provides accessors to obtain
   the values assigned to each.  These include</PRE>
<PRE>
     debug
     daemon
     autodiscover
     config 
     output
     pidfile
     server
     port
     silent
     help</PRE>
<PRE>
   Explanations of each are included elsewhere in this documentation.</PRE>
<P>2) Parse the command-line options and get their values.  This is done
   with the <CODE>Net::Peep::Client-&gt;parseopts()</CODE> method:</P>
<PRE>
     $client-&gt;parseopts(%options);</PRE>
<PRE>
   As part of our example, we will print or log the values of 'foo' and
   'bar' for the user to see.  Note that following the parsing of the
   default command-line options by the Net::Peep::Client object,</PRE>
<PRE>
   o The log class has been initialized to log to whatever file was 
     specified by the 'logfile' option (or STDERR if none was specified),
     and 
   o Debugging levels that were specified on the command-line have 
     been set.</PRE>
<PRE>
     $log-&gt;log(&quot;You specified the option [foo] to be [$foo].&quot;); 
     $log-&gt;log(&quot;You specified the option [bar] to be [$bar].&quot;);</PRE>
<PRE>
   You may also want to take specific actions based on the values of
   the options.</PRE>
<P>3) Parse the Peep configuration file.  This is done with the
   <CODE>Net::Peep::Client-&gt;</CODE>parseconf()&gt; method:</P>
<PRE>
     $client-&gt;parseconf();</PRE>
<PRE>
   The name of the configuration file can be specified on the command
   line with the C&lt;option&gt;.  (This is one of the set of standard
   options that the Net::Peep::Client object parses).  If it is not passed
   in as a command-line argument, it defaults to C&lt;/etc/peep.conf&gt;.</PRE>
<PRE>
   After you have parsed the configuration file, you can get a
   configuration object which has all of your option and configuration
   information.</PRE>
<PRE>
   The C&lt;Net::Peep::Client-E&lt;gt&gt;getconf()&gt; method returns a
   Net::Peep::Conf Peep configuration object populated with all of the
   information specified in the Peep configuration file:</PRE>
<PRE>
     my $conf = $client-&gt;getconf();</PRE>
<PRE>
   See the Net::Peep::Conf documentation for more detail.</PRE>
<P>4) Register a callback.  This should be a reference to a subroutine,
   and is registered by using the <CODE>Net::Peep::Client-&gt;callback()</CODE>
   method:</P>
<PRE>
     $client-&gt;callback(sub { &amp;MyLoop($foo,$bar) });</PRE>
<PRE>
   Typically, you would have a call to the
   C&lt;Net::Peep::BC-E&lt;gt&gt;send()&gt; method somewhere in your loop.  See
   the Net::Peep::BC (BC stands for BroadCast) documentation for more
   information.</PRE>
<PRE>
   More detailed information on creating the looping subroutine can be
   found below.</PRE>
<P>5) Finally, enter the main loop:</P>
<PRE>
     $client-&gt;MainLoop(); # executes the callback once</PRE>
<PRE>
   If your client is an event-driven client (that is, if it processes
   its own events), then MainLoop should be called with no arguments,
   in which case it executes the callback once.</PRE>
<PRE>
   If your client is a looping client (that is, if it enters into an
   infinite loop which is called at regular intervals), then call
   MainLoop with an argument indicating how many seconds you want
   between calls to the callback; e.g.,</PRE>
<PRE>
     $client-&gt;MainLoop(10); # execute the callback every 10 seconds</PRE>
<P>That is all there is to it!</P>
