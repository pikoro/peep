The wishlist:

============
* This list will eventually be moved into the sourceforge feature
* tracker
============

Stuff for more immediate attention:
* Fix this request: if we choose to run the client with
  -noautodiscovery, why not take as default the values
  found in the config? (for the server name and the server port) ?
* Fix problem where server can only pick itself out of the config
  if the hostname has a certain format. (sorta fixed via peep.conf
  generation and uname -n?).

Stuff to be done/looked at eventually:

* Fix ALSA compilations with latest version of ALSA
	* This is on hold until ALSA gets their act together. They are
	  currently working on v0.5.0 which is all over the place and want
	  me to wait until 0.6.x to do any updates. The current code works
	  with 0.4.x.
* Integrate Esound so Peep server can share sound device with other apps.
	* Maybe someone would like to take a look into this one?
* Integrate peepd experimental GUI.

Some cool audio stuff to investigate:

* Different sounds for states like (stream for low load, river for 
  higher load, ocean for highest load)
* implement dither (time dynamics) 
* upon state change, take a parameter that describes fade from old to new. 
  (new volume, position, source, etc.) 
* last idea (probably last feature of peepd) is pitch bending (interpolative sampling)
