=head1 NAME

Net::Peep - Perl extension for Peep:  The Network Auralizer.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Peep is an open source free software network monitoring tool issued
under the Gnu General Public License that presents information via
audio output.  Network diagnosis with Peep is made not only based on
single network events, but the network as a whole "sounds normal."

This document serves as an introduction to the Peep clients and the
Peep client architecture.

=head1 REQUIRES

  File::Tail
  Time::HiRes
  Net::Ping::External

=head1 INTRODUCTION

Peep is built on a client-server model in which the clients generate
"events" based on user-defined criteria (e.g., whether a packet denial
has been logged or a broken link on a web site was found).  One or
several Peep servers are then notified of the events by clients, at
which time an audio signal is generated.

The clients, which include such applications as C<logparser> and
C<sysmonitor> and for which this document constitutes introductory
documentation, are written in Perl, IMHO about the coolest language
ever.  The bulk of the client code is composed of a set of Perl
modules comprising objects and base classes for use by Peep clients
and their derivatives.

The server, C<peepd>, is written in C.

Both the client and server are available for download free of charge
from the Peep homepage located at

  http://peep.sourceforge.net

The Peep client modules and executables are also available on the CPAN
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) for installation via the
time-honored

  perl -MCPAN -e "install Net::Peep"

In fact, this is the preferred method of installation of the Peep
clients.

Consult the core Peep documentation for more information on
installation and usage of Peep.

The Peep client library is composed of the following modules:

  Perl Modules
  ------------

  Net::Peep            A non-functional module.  Simply holds 
                       POD documentation for Peep; in fact, 
                       it holds the documentation that you are
                       reading right now!

  Net::Peep::Conf      The Peep configuration object.  An  
                       object representation of peep.conf.

  Net::Peep::Parser    The Peep configuration file parser.  Reads  
                       peep.conf and populates Peep::Conf 
                       appropriately.

  Net::Peep::BC        The Peep broadcast module.  Used to notify Peep  
                       servers that an event has been generated.

  Net::Peep::Log       Provides utility methods for logging, debugging,
                       and benchmarking.

  Net::Peep::Client    Base and utility class for Peep clients and 
                       client modules.

  Net::Peep::Client::Logparser  Utility class for the logparser client.

  Net::Peep::Client::Sysmonitor Utility class for the sysmonitor client.

  Net::Peep::Peck      Utility class for the peck client.

  Clients
  -------

  logparser            Generates events based on matching regular
                       expressions to tailed logs (e.g., 
                       /var/log/messages).

  sysmonitor           Generates events based on system events (e.g.,
                       load average exceeding 2.0).

  peck                 Generates ad hoc Peep events.  Primarily for 
                       testing purposes.

  keytest              Generates ad hoc Peep events.  Primarily for 
                       fun.

Please refer to the individual modules of the Peep distribution (e.g.,
Net::Peep::BC) or the Peep client executables (e.g., logparser) for
further documentation.

=head1 CREATING A CUSTOM PEEP CLIENT

Please note that the Peep client API has not yet been finalized, and
is subject to change.  If you have any problems with your custom-built
client as a result of changes made to the client API, please contact
Collin Starkweather at collin.starkweather@colorado.edu.

The Net::Peep::Client module makes constructing a custom Peep client a
breeze.

The Net::Peep::Client::Logparser and Net::Peep::Client::Sysmonitor modules are
excellent references.  Pay particular attention to the Start methods
in each and thier usage of the Net::Peep::BC module, which notifies
the Peep server of Peep client events.

A Peep client by no means has to be a module, however.  It can just as
easily be created as a script.  The Peep::Client::Logparser and
Peep::Client::Sysmonitor modules, which correspond to the logparser
and system clients, were created as modules simply for ease of
distribution.

Basically, the same formula is used for each client.  

0) This goes without saying, but I will say it anyway.  First you have
to instantiate a Net::Peep::Client object.  For convenience, we
will also create a Net::Peep::Log object for logging and debugging
messages.  Creating the logging object is by no means necessary.

  use Net::Peep::Client;
  use Net::Peep::Log;
  my $client = new Net::Peep::Client.
  my $log    = new Net::Peep::Log;
   
1) Tell Net::Peep::Client what command-line options to parse.  For more
information on how to define command-line options, see
Getopt::Long, which Net::Peep::Client uses to parse the options.

To do this, create a hash of options.  For more information on the
format of the options, see the documentation for Getopt::Long.

For example, if you want to use the options 'foo' and 'bar', with
'foo' accepting a string and 'bar' a binary flag (implying that nobar
is the negation of the option):

   my $foo = ''; # be sure to initialize your options
   my $bar = 0;
   my %options = (
     'foo=s' => \$foo, # =s implies a string is expected
     'bar!'  => \$bar  # ! implies negation with nobar
   );

Note that Net::Peep::Client accepts a set of default command-line
options common to all Peep clients and provides accessors to obtain
the values assigned to each.  These include

     debug
     daemon
     autodiscover
     config 
     output
     pidfile
     server
     port
     silent
     help

Explanations of each are included elsewhere in this documentation.

2) Parse the command-line options and get their values.  This is done
with the C<Net::Peep::Client-E<gt>parseopts()> method:

     $client->parseopts(%options);

As part of our example, we will print or log the values of 'foo' and
'bar' for the user to see.  Note that following the parsing of the
default command-line options by the Net::Peep::Client object,

   o The log class has been initialized to log to whatever file was 
     specified by the 'logfile' option (or STDERR if none was specified),
     and 
   o Debugging levels that were specified on the command-line have 
     been set.

     $log->log("You specified the option [foo] to be [$foo]."); 
     $log->log("You specified the option [bar] to be [$bar].");

You may also want to take specific actions based on the values of
the options.

3) Parse the Peep configuration file.  This is done with the
C<Net::Peep::Client-E<gt>>parseconf()> method:

     $client->parseconf();

The name of the configuration file can be specified on the command
line with the C<option>.  (This is one of the set of standard
options that the Net::Peep::Client object parses).  If it is not passed
in as a command-line argument, it defaults to C</etc/peep.conf>.

After you have parsed the configuration file, you can get a
configuration object which has all of your option and configuration
information.

The C<Net::Peep::Client-E<gt>getconf()> method returns a
Net::Peep::Conf Peep configuration object populated with all of the
information specified in the Peep configuration file:

  my $conf = $client->getconf();

See the Net::Peep::Conf documentation for more detail.

4) Register a callback.  This should be a reference to a subroutine,
and is registered by using the C<Net::Peep::Client-E<gt>callback()>
method:

  $client->callback(sub { &MyLoop($foo,$bar) });

Typically, you would have a call to the
C<Net::Peep::BC-E<gt>send()> method somewhere in your loop.  See
the Net::Peep::BC (BC stands for BroadCast) documentation for more
information.

More detailed information on creating the looping subroutine can be
found below.

5) Finally, enter the main loop:

  $client->MainLoop(); # executes the callback once

If your client is an event-driven client (that is, if it processes
its own events), then MainLoop should be called with no arguments,
in which case it executes the callback once.

If your client is a looping client (that is, if it enters into an
infinite loop which is called at regular intervals), then call
MainLoop with an argument indicating how many seconds you want
between calls to the callback; e.g.,

  $client->MainLoop(10); # execute the callback every 10 seconds

That is all there is to it!
