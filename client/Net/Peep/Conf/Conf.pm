=head1 NAME

Net::Peep::Conf - Perl extension for providing an object
representation of configuration information for Peep: The Network
Auralizer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Peep::Conf;
  my $conf = new Net::Peep::Conf;
  $conf->setBroadcast($class0,$value0);
  $conf->setBroadcast($class1,$value1);
  $conf->getBroadcastList();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Peep::Conf provides an object interface for Peep configuration
information, typically extracted from a Peep configuration file (e.g.,
/etc/peep.conf) by the Net::Peep::Parser module.

=head1 EXPORT

None by default.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

  setApp($appname) - A unique identifier associated with a client
  configuration.  Typically the name of the application using the
  configuration information; e.g., logparser.

  getApp() - Returns the identifier set with setApp.

  getPort() - Returns the port set with setPort.

  setPort($port) - Sets a port number.  Typically the client broadcast
  port.

  getBroadcastList() - Returns a list of all broadcast names
  associated with all classes.

  getBroadcast($class) - Gets the broadcast string for the class
  $class.

  addBroadcast($class,$value) - Adds the broadcast string
  (consisting of IP/domain and port) named $name for the class $class.

  getClassList() - Returns a list of all class names that have
  associated server lists.

  getClass($class) - Returns a list of servers associated with the
  class $class.

  setClass($class,$arrayref) - Associates the class $class with the
  list of servers given in $arrayref.

  getEventList() - Returns a list of all event names.

  getEvent($event) - Returns the event information for the event with
  name $event.

  setEvent($event,$hashref) - Associates the event $event with the
  information contained in $hashref.

  getStateList() - Returns a list of all state names.

  getState($state) - Returns the state information associated with the
  state $state.

  setState($event,$hashref) - Associates the state $state with the
  information contained in $hashref.

  setConfigurationText($text) - Sets the configuration text to $text.

  getConfigurationText() - Returns the configuration text.

  setClientEvent($name,$arrayref) - Sets the events associated with
  the client $name.

  getClientEvents($name) - Returns the events associated with the client $name.

  getClientEventList() - Returns all events associated with all clients.

  checkClientEvent() - The method name is a question: Based on
  command-line or configuration file settings, should this client
  event be considered active in the current client?  For example,
  should the logparser check the regular expression for this event
  against log files?

=head1 CHANGE LOG

$Log: Conf.pm,v $
Revision 1.5  2001/07/23 20:17:45  starky
Fixed a minor bug in setting groups and exclude flags from the command-line
with the logparser.

Revision 1.4  2001/07/23 17:46:29  starky
Added versioning to the configuration file as well as the ability to
specify groups in addition to / as a replacement for event letters.
Also changed the Net::Peep::Parse namespace to Net::Peep::Parser.
(I don't know why I ever named an object by a verb!)

Revision 1.3  2001/07/20 03:19:58  starky
Some trivial changes.  They normally wouldn't be committed at this stage,
but the code is being prepped for the 0.4.2 release.

Revision 1.2  2001/05/07 02:39:19  starky
A variety of bug fixes and enhancements:
o Fixed bug 421729:  Now the --output flag should work as expected and the
--logfile flag should not produce any unexpected behavior.
o Documentation has been updated and improved, though more improvements
and additions are pending.
o Removed print STDERRs I'd accidentally left in the last commit.
o Other miscellaneous and sundry bug fixes in anticipation of a 0.4.2
release.

Revision 1.1  2001/04/23 10:13:19  starky
Commit in preparation for release 0.4.1.

o Altered package namespace of Peep clients to Net::Peep
  at the suggestion of a CPAN administrator.
o Changed Peep::Client::Log to Net::Peep::Client::Logparser
  and Peep::Client::System to Net::Peep::Client::Sysmonitor
  for clarity.
o Made adjustments to documentation.
o Fixed miscellaneous bugs.

Revision 1.7  2001/04/17 06:46:21  starky
Hopefully the last commit before submission of the Peep client library
to the CPAN.  Among the changes:

o The clients have been modified somewhat to more elagantly
  clean up pidfiles in response to sigint and sigterm signals.
o Minor changes have been made to the documentation.
o The Peep::Client module searches through a host of directories in
  order to find peep.conf if it is not immediately found in /etc or
  provided on the command line.
o The make test script conf.t was modified to provide output during
  the testing process.
o Changes files and test.pl files were added to prevent specious
  complaints during the make process.

Revision 1.6  2001/03/31 07:51:35  mgilfix


  Last major commit before the 0.4.0 release. All of the newly rewritten
clients and libraries are now working and are nicely formatted. The server
installation has been changed a bit so now peep.conf is generated from
the template file during a configure - which brings us closer to having
a work-out-of-the-box system.

clients and libraries are now working and are nicely formatted. The server
installation has been changed a bit so now peep.conf is generated from
the template file during a configure - which brings us closer to having
a work-out-of-the-box system.

Revision 1.7  2001/03/31 02:17:00  mgilfix
Made the final adjustments to for the 0.4.0 release so everything
now works. Lots of changes here: autodiscovery works in every
situation now (client up, server starts & vice-versa), clients
now shutdown elegantly with a SIGTERM or SIGINT and remove their
pidfiles upon exit, broadcast and server definitions in the class
definitions is now parsed correctly, the client libraries now
parse the events so they can translate from names to internal
numbers. There's probably some other changes in there but many
were made :) Also reformatted all of the code, so it uses
consistent indentation.

Revision 1.5  2001/03/28 02:41:48  starky
Created a new client called 'pinger' which pings a set of hosts to check
whether they are alive.  Made some adjustments to the client modules to
accomodate the new client.

Also fixed some trivial pre-0.4.0-launch bugs.

Revision 1.4  2001/03/27 05:49:04  starky
Modified the getClientPort method to accept the 'port' option as
specified on the command line if no client has been specified in the
conf file.

Revision 1.3  2001/03/27 00:44:19  starky
Completed work on rearchitecting the Peep client API, modified client code
to be consistent with the new API, and added and tested the sysmonitor
client, which replaces the uptime client.

This is the last major commit prior to launching the new client code,
though the API or architecture may undergo some initial changes following
launch in response to comments or suggestions from the user and developer
