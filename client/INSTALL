To install the Peep client libraries,

  cd Net/Peep
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

It's easier than falling off a log.

If typing 5 commands is too much effort or if you just want the latest
stable release off the CPAN, you can 

  perl -MCPAN -e "install Net::Peep"

Contact Collin Starkweather at collin.starkweather@colorado.edu if you
have any problems.  Keep in mind that I'm a graduate student, and
though I'll make every effort to answer promptly, sometimes I get a
bit behind in my e-mail :-)
