* From 0.4.1 to 0.4.2
  * Scheduler code has been integrated into the client
    library code base
  * Serveral bugfixes including bugs #440590 and #439881.
  * The pinger module has been added into the distro,
    although its not yet functional.

* From 0.4.0 to 0.4.1
  * Clients have been re-architected to fit into the CPAN
    scheme and also now available over CPAN. Just run
    a: perl -MCPAN -e'install Net::Peep'.
  * Consequently, the Peep libraries have been moved
    to Net::Peep
  * All extern declarations have been moved behind
    accessor functions in the server code. The header
    files now include all documentation for the functions
    within those files.
  * Bugfixes for the clients - check their respective
    changelogs via perldoc.

* From 0.4.0-pre1 to 0.4.0
  * Sounds are now categorized! Please download the new
    sound package, with more detailed info and organization
    of the sound repository.
  * automake has been updated for installation of the new
    sound repository, as well as for creating distributions
    via a "make dist".
  * Major update to the Peep general documentation to reflect
    all the changes in the code base.
  * The new client documentation has been created.
  * The client code has been updated and the utils code base
    has been replaced.
  * peep.conf is now generated during a configure, and
    will work nicely on any linux system. With other systems,
    we currently have problems determining the broadcast
    address.

* From 0.3.8 to 0.4.0-pre1
  * Playback feature has now been added. Users can create
    recordings of past events and play back events between
    certain times
  * Auto-discovery bug has been fixed (Bug #231359)
  * Major code reorganization - files are now completely
    modularized and the code has been nicely cleaned up.
  * Debugging routines have now been formalized and moved
    into their own modules and debugging levels have also
    been defined.
  * The pre-alpha client code has been made available
    for exploration in the code base. It will eventually
    replace the utility directory.

* From 0.3.7 to 0.3.8
  * Utilities now read command-line options from peep.conf
  * Fixed Uptime and LogParser help messages

* From 0.3.6 to 0.3.7
  * The server and LogParser and Uptime are now daemons. They
    also write their pids out into a file 
    (default: /var/run/<name>.pid)
  * The utilties now use #!/usr/bin/perl.
  * Changing LogParser's output a little.

* From 0.3.5 to 0.3.6
  * Changed LogParser so that users can now choose between
    autodiscovery and direct connctions.
  * Added some minor error checking for system calls. Should
    avoid segfaulting on blank indentifiers
  * Tweaked the code for File::Tail so that events are picked
    up faster. Users can tweak the parameters of the constants
    in terms of performance vs. CPU usage.

* From 0.3.4 to 0.3.5
  * Changed LogParser to use File::Tail instead of LogTail.pm.
    This fixes its CPU usage

* From 0.3.3 to 0.3.4
  * Edited the code to confer with a naming scheme,
    as well as proper spacing. It looks much better now.
    The naming scheme is:
      Globals: Starts with caps, delimited with '_'
               Ex: Snds_Per_State or Snds
      locals:  All lowercase, delimeted with '_'
               Ex: var_foo or var
      functions: Starts with caps, words combined
               Ex: EnginePoll or Enqueue
  * Fixed some bugs with LogParser
  * Added a volume cap for dynamic volumes to event and
    states so that total volumes are in ratios (7.0 events
    to 0.3 states)
  * Fixed an autodiscovery bug whereby clients wouldn't
    bind to servers when they were started after the servers

* From 0.3.2 to 0.3.3
  * Changed mutex locking problem that would wedge the
    server with large array of events
  * Added KeyTest. Maps 24 events and 11 states to the
    keyboard as well all control parameters. Good for
    testing/experimenting. Needs event->name mapping
    though
  * Fixed shutdown segfault.
  * Adding better debugging messages

For 0.3.1: (We're dropping this alpha label)

  - Revamped configuration file. Contains configuration for 
    utilities as well as the Peep server.
  - Autodiscovery was added. Clients and servers now bind to 
    each other upon startup.
  - Dynamic volume mixing. Volumes of sounds are set dynamically 
    based on the volume of what's currently playing so as to 
    avoid clipping.

For 0.2.1alpha:

  - Added support for tcp_wrappers. To compile with
    tcp wrappers, simpley do a:
      configure --with-libwrap[=PATH] 
    where the path to the library is optional. 

Some of the more interesting things the 0.2.0 alpha 
release supports are:

- Stereo location for both event and state sounds
- Ability to assign up to 99 variations on a given event sound
  and have one of those varations chosen randomly when the
  event occurs
- A dither parameter that tells the engine when to start doing
  a linear fade on the current state sound while fading the
  next state sound in.
- An event priority
